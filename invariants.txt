Two invariants:

1. For any Uarray, accessing the element at [i,j] in the UArray2 will get 
exactly one element in row i, column j in the 2D array, unless i or j are 
out of bounds.

2. Every row in a given UArray2 is the same width and every column in a given 
UArray2 is the same height, where the width and height are non negative.
